# Rectangular Grid Path Planner
## Aim
This project aims to create a program that determines the shortest path (and time) required from one point to another in a rectangular grid.
## Summary
Given a rectangular grid and the time it takes to traverse one path to another, this program accepts the grid, source and destination as input and output the shortest path and time. The program also displays the summary of the grid, such as its dimensions and paths that are not traversable (marked with the time cost of 999). The algorithm used is derived from Dijkstra's algorithm, but the execution is brute-force based.
## Guide
The project is divided into two stages:
* Stage 1 determines the summary of the rectangular grid.
* Stage 2 involves determining the shortest path from one point to another, as given from the input and the total time it takes to traverse it
